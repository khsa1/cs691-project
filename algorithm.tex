\section{Algorithm}

We will look for ways to parallelize gSpan.  The naive implementation will
attempt to parallelize the DFS code generation stage of gSpan, which is
generated from all the 1-edge graphs in Algorithm 1 in \cite{gspan}.  
Shared-memory implementations do this.  This should lead to a pure 
MPI implementation of algorithm.  However, since the computational
complexity of each recursive subgraph mining is unknown, this will lead
to an unbalanced amount of work on each node. 

With that in mind, we will experiment with more ways to distribute the work, 
and explore a hybrid MPI and shared memory model in the hopes of getting
better results.
