Frequent Subgraph Mining (FSM) is the general computational problem of
identifying what subgraphs occur frequently in a collection of graphs.
The dominant FSM algorithm over the past decade has been gSpan.
gSpan has been shown to give good performance relative to other existing
systems from both a computational time and memory consumption standpoint.
gSpan and algorithms like it are difficult to parallelize as it does a
recursive depth-first search of the solution space, and each search
can take a variable amount of time.

This paper demonstrates a parallel implementation of this algorithm that uses
MPI to divide up the search space among multiple nodes within a cluster to
provide faster overall search times.
